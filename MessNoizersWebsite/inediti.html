        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Ce's song</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">red car in a road <br>
            long on trees and stones.<br>
            listen to the roar <br>
            of a driving gas, to the shore<br><br>

            feels like hangin' down<br>
            the cliff on the ground<br>
            now listen to the beat<br>
            of this rock n rooool<br>

            oh-oh oh-oh yeah<br><br>


            but as all memories come back<br>
            you know you're lost in your own trap<br>
            and as you look on down below<br>
            consider maybe that's your fault..<br><br>



            in my fairy dreams<br>
            diving narrow streams<br>
            talking to the trees<br>
            but waking up before - the show<br><br>

            singin this rock song<br>
            the zar has told along<br>
            hearing your blood pulse<br>
            and smelling all the sweat<br>

            swe-e-e-e-eat<br>
            ooooh yeah<br><br>



            but as all memories come back<br>
            you know you're lost in your own trap<br>
            and if you look on down below<br>
            consider maybe that's your fault

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Indians</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">stuck in a lost, wild, dirty town <br>
            feeling this boring shit everyday <br>
            my eyes can't burn or turn, watching the sun <br>
            of bitches, money, mines and lawyers, i've had enough<br><br>

            and suddenly I hear that echo from the distance<br>
            woo looking at the horizon i can feel even more<br>
            i want to see, ex-plore and seek for adventures<br>
            so fuck this western bubble that i dare to call home<br><br>

            I wish i was a boy in the country of indians<br>
            running naked in the forest, niente est e niente ovest<br>
            where nature and i can have a sweet contact<br>
            livin' with nothing but fire and water<br><br>

            rocks all around, rolling and stoning<br>
            the eagle picks my mind, a wizard passes by<br>
            the deer drinking from the pure clean river<br>
            while i'm still here selling fake plastic livers<br><br>

            and suddenly I hear that echo from the distance<br>
            woo looking at the horizon i can feel even more<br>
            i want to see, ex-plore and seek for adventures<br>
            so fuck this western bubble that i dare to call home<br><br>


            I wish i was a boy in the country of indians<br>
            running naked in the forest, niente est e niente ovest<br>
            where nature and i can have a sweet contact<br>
            livin' with nothing but fire and water</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Dream Girl</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Listen mama talk bout this new bad girl <br>
            She came along this song and she made me real nerv <br><br>

            WOW<br><br>

            now I can't believe I'll get to know her<br>

            she seems so cool and so mean<br>

            I wonder why she comes in a so small bad town<br>

            and where she is coming from<br>

            maybe she's all right and my mama's joking<br>

            but as she stands there i seee<br><br>



            She plays a white guitar<br>

            Wearing a red cool jack<br>

            Driving a motorbike <br>

            yeah<br>

            She's my dream girl<br><br>

            Everything in my heart says oh-oh-oh yeah<br>

            She's rockin' the place apart<br>

            And I can see nothin' but deep cool hot eyes<br>

            and all the things they hide inside<br><br>


            Oh baby maybe we could be like lovers<br>

            Or we could just start a band<br>

            You are just the kinda girl I've always wanted<br>

            You're pretty, punky, funny and<br><br>


            You Play a white guitar<br>

            you wear a red cool jack<br>

            you ride a motorbike<br>

            At Night
            <br>
            when the danger comes<br>
            and the warriors arise <br>
            and the moon doesn't shine<br>
            but you cannot be minee<br><br>




            I Can't let you go<br>

            You Are my dream girl<br>

            All The things i've done<br>

            You Have done them more<br>

            Because<br>

            Now You<br>

            Yes You<br><br>


            You play a White Guitar<br>

            Wearing a red cool jack<br>

            Breaking the heart of minee<br>



            My Dream girl<br>

            she chase the ticks of time<br>

            on top of her leather dress<br>

            She flies me to space at once<br>



            ma ma dream<br>
